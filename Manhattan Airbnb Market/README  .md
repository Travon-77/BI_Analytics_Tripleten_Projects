# Spreadsheet Data Analysis: Manhattan Airbnb Market

This project analyzes Airbnb data to help a client make informed investment decisions in the Manhattan vacation rental market. The goal is to identify which **neighborhoods** and **property sizes** are most attractive and how much revenue they can generate.

## Objectives

- Determine the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes (bedrooms) for vacation rentals.
- Estimate potential revenue for top-performing listings.

## Key Questions Answered

1. Which neighborhoods and property sizes are most attractive for vacation rentals?
2. How much revenue did the top listings generate?

## Dataset

**Source**: NYC Airbnb Open Data  
- Listings and calendar data
- Main metrics: `number_of_reviews_ltm`, `adjusted_price`, `available`

## Data Cleaning Steps

- Cleaned `neighborhood` column: removed inconsistent capitalization and trailing spaces → `neighborhood_clean`
- Cleaned `bedrooms` column: replaced blanks with 0 (studio apartments) → `bedrooms_clean`
- Created a column `top_listing`: flagged listings that matched our target criteria
- Created `revenue_earned`: based on availability and adjusted price
